# Product Landing Page

---

The aim of this landing page is to promote the
Van Rysel Gravel bike by providing photos and
detailed information, with the ultimate goal of
providing a great user experience and enticing
users to engage and purchase.

The landing page adheres to the Decathlon Design
System and the world wide web consortium. Images
have a standard dimension and are below 300kb.
Fonts are optimised accordingly throughout the
landing page for all screen sizes.

## Features

---

The first part of the landing page consists of two
separate columns, with the first column displaying
a montage of photos and the second displaying the
product details.

Product photos are of vital importance in engaging
and enticing the user to purchase. A Swiper JS
feature was used which allows for a prominent photo
of the bike to be displayed. Large thumbnail photos
are then displayed underneath and can be easily
swiped and clicked to take precedent in the main
window. A zoom feature should also be added to
enhance the interaction yet the Swiper JS feature
could be suffice for the user and hence reduce
the number of clicks.

The product details are aligned to the right of
the photo feature with the decathlon-coloured
button being prominent and easily viewed.

For smaller devices the two column structure
reduces to one column for a better layout.

For the second part of the landing page the
product details are provided.

To provide the best user experience the product
details are provided within a ‘Tab’ feature for
desktop and an ‘Accordion’ feature for mobile.

The tab feature allows for users to choose their
particular interest, whether it be
‘Product Benefits’ or ‘Bike Spec’, without being
navigated to different sections of the page. It
keeps the user engaged and focused in the decision
at hand, with the button to purchase largely
remaining visible and in eyesight.

The tab feature headings are against an off-white
background with the first tab panel always opened
as default so that the user is aware of the options
available.

The ‘Accordion’ feature for the bike details will
give a much better user experience for mobile.
A simple heading can be clicked and the panel opened
and closed at the users discretion.

A scroll feature is added in the bottom right of
the screen for all screen sizes. This is a great
feature to allow users to always quickly go to
top of the page rather than scrolling up.
